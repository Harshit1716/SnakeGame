# React Native Snake Game üêç

Welcome to the React Native Snake Game, a fun project that combines nostalgia with modern mobile development! Remember the good old days when we used to play Snake on our chunky old phones? Well, get ready to experience that same addictive gameplay on your sleek, modern smartphone.

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First things first, let's fire up Metro, the JavaScript bundler that powers React Native. Simply run the following command from the root of your React Native project:

```bash
npm start
# OR
yarn start
```

### Step 2: Start Your Application

Now that Metro is running, open a new terminal and start your app on either Android or iOS:

#### For Android

```bash
npm run android
# OR
yarn android
```

#### For iOS

```bash
npm run ios
# OR
yarn ios
```

Sit back and watch as your new Snake game launches on your emulator or simulator!

### Step 3: Let's Play!

Once your game is up and running, get ready to dive into the world of Snake. Navigate the snake using simple swipe gestures‚Äîjust like in the old days. Can you eat as much food as possible without crashing into yourself or the walls? Let's find out!

## How to Play

1. **Swipe Gestures**: Swipe in the direction you want the snake to move‚Äîup, down, left, or right.
   
2. **Eat Food**: Guide the snake to eat the food scattered across the screen. Each food eaten increases your score.

3. **Avoid Collisions**: Be careful not to collide with the snake's own body or the walls of the game area. One wrong move, and it's game over!

## Relive the Nostalgia

With React Native Snake Game, you can relive the thrill of playing Snake on your old-school phone, but with a modern twist. It's the perfect blend of nostalgia and cutting-edge technology‚Äîall in the palm of your hand.

So what are you waiting for? Dive in, swipe away, and let the nostalgia flow!

**Disclaimer:** React Native Snake Game is just a fun project, meant to bring back the joy of playing Snake in a new and exciting way.
